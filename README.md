# Quizlet Questions Bypass

## Description
Unblur KaTex and remove paywalls.
Also displays quizlet step-by-step guide images on the bottom of the page.

Because KaTex is not obfuscated or encrypted on the Quizlet website, it is currently the best script for unblurring anything involving math. Some KaTex may still be changed, however (unlikely). Make sure you follow the solutions step-by-step!

To install, use Tamper Monkey and create a new script. Copy and paste the code into a script, then do File -> Save.
Try it on a random explanation like [this](https://quizlet.com/explanations/questions/a-cylindrical-tank-with-a-2-12908986-fe03-4daf-ba30-3bfc446f8449).

This works extremely well with the [Quizlet Bypass](https://github.com/rospino74/Quizlet-Bypass).
It can be an add-on for it if, in some cases, the bypass does not work and you need to refresh.

## Why did you make this?
Educational content and resources to learn should never be something to pay for. Given how deeply embedded Quizlet was in school curricula, the fact that content has been locked behind a paywall is an insult to all of us.

## Minor Bugs
The buttons on the bottom may be incorrect. If you have multiple "Back to Textbook" buttons, click the last one.Â
